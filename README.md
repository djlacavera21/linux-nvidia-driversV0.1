# nvlx: Linux-NVIDIA-Driver v1.6.6.6.6.6.6.6.6.6.3.3.1.2.3.4.5.6.7.5.6.7.8.5.1.2.3

`nvlx` v1.6.6.6.6.6.6.6.6.6.3.3.1.2.3.4.5.6.7.5.6.7.8.5.1.2.3 adds `X-Datadog-Sampling-Priority` Connection-nomination containment to the live HTTP surface. After inherited ingress and tracing/proxy-metadata gates succeed, the server rejects an exact `x-datadog-sampling-priority` Connection option before endpoint/runtime evaluation while continuing to admit ordinary `X-Datadog-Sampling-Priority` fields.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> NVIDIA driver/GPU Operator resources remain read-only. The operator still mutates only nvlx-owned GPUFleet status/finalizers plus its existing Lease and Events.

## v1.6.6.6.6.6.6.6.6.6.3.3.1.2.3.4.5.6.7.5.6.7.8.5.1.2.3 X-Datadog-Sampling-Priority Connection-nomination containment

- **Ordinary Datadog sampling metadata remains admissible.** `X-Datadog-Sampling-Priority` is accepted when all inherited gates accept the request.
- **Hop-by-hop demotion is terminal.** Exact `x-datadog-sampling-priority` Connection nomination receives canonical `400 Request Rejected` framing.
- **Matching is case-insensitive.** Mixed-case exact nominations are rejected.
- **Substring lookalikes remain outside this rule.** `x-datadog-sampling-priority-x` remains valid when otherwise admissible.
- **Values remain opaque at this layer.** This containment examines only Connection option names and does not validate or reinterpret Datadog sampling priorities. Envoy documents `X-Datadog-Sampling-Priority` as the integer sampling decision for the trace, where `0` means do not collect and `1` requests sampling and reporting.
- **HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 are covered.**
- **Earlier gates retain precedence.** The complete inherited framing, credential, forwarding/client-address, Envoy timeout/retry/hedging, retriable-header/status, alt-stat, timeout-alt-response, timeout-retry-provenance, original-host, upstream-stream-duration, downstream-service-cluster/node, force-trace, IP-tags, XFCC, request-ID, client-trace-ID, OT-span-context, B3 trace-ID, B3 span-ID, B3 parent-span-ID, B3 sampled, B3 flags, compressed B3, Datadog trace-ID, and Datadog parent-ID gates run before this layer.
- **Expect handling remains canonical.** Requests carrying `Expect` still terminate through the inherited `417 Request Rejected` path with no interim `100 Continue`.
- **HEAD rejection remains bodyless.** Representation `Content-Length` is preserved without sending the rejection body.
- **Pipeline and runtime isolation remain intact.** Rejected requests cannot dispatch trailing pipelined bytes or invoke readiness/metrics evaluation.
- **Admission capacity recovers normally.** Rejection releases its bounded worker slot.
- **Ingress budgets are unchanged.** 8 KiB request line, 32 KiB aggregate headers, 32 fields, 5-second idle timeout, 5-second absolute header deadline, 32 concurrent requests.
- **The live operator now uses `http_v1666666666331123456756785123`.** The live runtime remains `runtime_v1664`.
- **Checkpoint persistence, Prometheus schema, RBAC, readiness policy, and NVIDIA mutation behavior are unchanged.**
